# Bites - Task Management Application

![Responsive Design](documentation/images/responsiveimg.png)

Bites is designed with neurodiversity in mind, offering a simple and intuitive approach to task management that helps reduce cognitive overload. Unlike busy, energy-draining apps, Bites uses a clean, minimal interface with bite-sized, color-coded task squares to make prioritising and organising tasks straightforward and stress-free. By focusing on clarity and ease of use, Bites helps users stay productive without feeling overwhelmed, so you can manage your day with more focus and less effort. Itâ€™s task management made to fit your flow, not disrupt it.The application is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.
